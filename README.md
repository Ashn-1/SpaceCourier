## Concept

The player flies in a spaceship avoiding obstacles that come in his way. He can use a shield that blocks all incoming obstacles for a short period of time. The shield has a cool down before it can be used again. There is a boss at the end of each level, who has to be defeated before proceeding to the next level. The levels are represented by planets that are visited.

## Score

The player gets points for:
* Advancing in the level
* Blocking projectiles with the shield

## Possible Features

Features that I might add if I see them fitting in the game along the way.

* Progression system similar to a rogue lite -> small things that can be upgraded throughout the game
* Unique levels for each planet with individual enemies, obstacles, etc.
* Custom ships
* Items that can be gathered by completing levels or doing quests/tasks
* Custom soundtrack designed by myself
* Barrel roll with iFrames
