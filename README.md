## Concept

The player roams around space to deliver packets to the people of the universe. However, space is a dangerous place to be flying around in; asteroids and pirates come in the way of the player, which he has to avoid. The further out into space he gets, the more dangerous it becomes. The player must utilize the abilities of his ship to navigate through all these dangers and get through to deliver the packages to the people. That is his sole mission.

## Gameplay

### World

Each planet and dwarf planet has one level dedicated to it. Each planets level is not endless and can be completed. The difficulty between each planet rises, but the player can freely choose which planet he wants to go to. Each planet awards the player with a unique reward after first completion. After completing all planets the player can play the endless solar system level containing all planets and going on until the player dies.
