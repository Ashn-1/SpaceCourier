## Concept

The player roams around space to deliver packets to the people of the universe. However, space is a dangerous place to be flying around in; asteroids and pirates come in the way of the player, which he has to avoid. Also the further the player gets the more difficult the game becomes. This includes more asteroids and different pirates that will attack the player. The player also unlocks different skills throughout his journey which can protect him or help him to evade danger.

## Gameplay

There is only one endless level. The player always starts at the beginning of this level and has to restart everytime he dies. Unlocked skills along the journey are kept through the attempts. The level gets progressively harder, the farther the player gets. The player will face several waves of asteroids, enemies and a boss at the end of each segment. Along the way there will be different spaceships that the player can deliver packets to, to get extra points.

## Score

The player gets points for:
* Advancing in the level
* Blocking/evading asteroids/pirates with the shield
* Delivering packets
